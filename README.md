# Shape Classifier
## Overview
This project demonstrates the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images of basic geometric shapes (circle, square, triangle). The images are synthetically generated using Python's PIL library and stored in a custom dataset. The model is trained, validated, and tested on this dataset. The goal is to classify the images into one of the three shape categories.
